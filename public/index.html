    <p>
      Spelling is how we put words together, but what is phonetic spelling? 
      It's an alternate way to create words. Phonetic spelling is a system of spelling in which each letter represents one spoken sound. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In English, some words are pronounced exactly as they look. When [b] is used to spell ball, the letter [b] is assigned one sound.
      Unfortunately, just knowing the English alphabet isn't enough to be a proficient speller in English. For example, 
      pairing [t] with [h] creates a new sound [th]. The T takes on a new pronunciation. 
      Furthermore, there is a difference in how the th- sound can be pronounced, such as with this and thin. 
      So that single letter [t] does not correlate to only one pronunciation.

    <p> 
    English pronunciation follows rules that arenâ€™t always obvious but if you invest some time in learning the <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/images/pronunciation/Phonemic-Chart.jpg"> phonetic alphabet</a>
     you will be able to read the phonetic spelling of words in dictionaries and figure out how to pronounce 
     tricky English words like choir.

      Phonetic spelling calls the Free Online Dictionary API that references International Phonetic Spelling.  
      In New Zealand English, some vowels have shifted - see if you can spot the vowel shifts.

      <br>
      <strong>Note:</strong> the Free Online Dictionary API has inconsistently indexed IPA spelling meaning some words may not display when searched.
      You can find the phonetic spelling of a word in any adult dictionary.
